# Airplanes-detection-satellite-images
This repository contains all what I have used to create my own dataset and its use with the model for objects detection YOLOv8 .

## 1. Dataset Creation

### 1.1 Image Capture
The images were taken from Google Maps in different places around the world to create a dataset as diverse as possible. This includes:
> +100 images with airplanes (civilian and military)

> +100 images without airplanes

### 1.2 Preprocessing
The images were resized (960x960) and renamed using the script `images_prep.py`

### 1.3 Labeling
The images containing airplanes were manually labeled using [labelImg](https://github.com/HumanSignal/labelImg). And I obtained empty `.txt`files using `empty_files.py`

### 1.4 Labels and images are organized
I split the images and lables `.txt` in training and validation sets 
> 222 labeled images for training (82% aprox)

> 50 labeled images for validation (18% aprox)

### 1.5 `dataset.yaml` file
The datasetÂ´s configuration file is written. It includes the path to the different folders and the names that receive the classes. In this case, only one class **0: airplane**
